# 2D FIR Example
This is a basic example on how to use an Altera FPGA as an Image/Video Accelerator.

## HW

There are example Quratus Project for Agilex 7, Arria 10, and Max 10.

## guide

There will be full guide on how to implment this example for your chosen target.

## TCL

This is a basic TCL to Telnet script to allow for easy connection to the JTAG debugger in the Quartus Design.

## python

This is the python ipynb example that you can run locally and connect with the Altera FPGA.

## data

Example image files to be used with the demo.
